# Files for Object2vr players

These files are generated by [object2vr](https://ggnome.com/object2vr) but we only want to serve one version.

- ### object2vr_player.js

  This can be replaced wholesale should they release new versions. Outputting any \*.o2vr project should produce this.

- ### skin.js

  This can be regenerated by outputting any \*.o2vr project where the skin has been set to `SMG-skin.ggsk`

- ### SMG-skin.ggsk
  This is the design source file, it can be loaded into object2vr to be modified. Note this zip structured file contains all the svg assets, but we serve these directly from the versions in `/public/` src'ed from `/client/icons/object2vr/`
