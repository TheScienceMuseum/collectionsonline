            for it</a>
        </p>

        <h3>What material is published online?</h3>

        <p>
          On the Science Museum Group collection website, you can find material published from our object and archival
          collections.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have over 500,000 objects and 50,000 archival documents published online.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our collection of 7 million items has been added to and documented since 1851. Some historic records within
          the collection may contain illustrations and descriptions that are offensive or reflect outdated ideas and
          analysis. This material does not reflect our values as an organisation that is <a
            href="https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/our-work/open-for-all/">Open for All</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are actively improving these historic records, including by adding context, correcting errors, changing
          language and calling out offensive characterisations. Sometimes we have retained original content as evidence
          of historic racism. Please <a
            href="https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/our-work/our-collection/ask-about-our-collection">contact us</a>
          if you have concerns about a specific record.
